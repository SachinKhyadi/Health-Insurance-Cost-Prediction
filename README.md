# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Solving Data Science problem using PYTHON on Predicting Healthcare Insurance Costs

This is data science project that combines healthcare insights and predictive analytics. Our task here is to predict customer healthcare costs using the power of machine learning. Our insights will help tailor services and guide customers in planning their healthcare expenses more effectively.

Dataset Summary
Our primary tool: the insurance.csv dataset. Packed with information on health insurance customers, this dataset is our key to unlocking patterns in healthcare costs. Here's what we need to know about the data you'll be working with:

## insurance.csv
| Column    | Data Type | Description                                                      |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `sex`       | object    | Gender of the insurance contractor (male or female).             |
| `bmi`       | float     | Body mass index, a key indicator of body fat based on height and weight. |
| `children`  | int       | Number of dependents covered by the insurance plan.              |
| `smoker`    | object    | Indicates whether the beneficiary smokes (yes or no).            |
